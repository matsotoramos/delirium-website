      <h1 style="text-align:center; margin-bottom:1rem;">Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 31 August 2025</p>
      <p><strong>Who we are.</strong> This Privacy Policy describes how <em>Tinamati</em> (“we”, “us”, “our”) processes information when you use the Delirium mobile application and this website.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:1.2rem;">1) Scope</h2>
      <p>This policy applies to: (a) the Delirium Android app distributed on Google Play, and (b) the public website located at this domain. If any app store listing describes additional data practices, those also apply.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:1.2rem;">2) What data we collect</h2>
      <ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
        <li><strong>Account &amp; identifiers (optional):</strong> If you sign in (e.g., Google/Apple Sign-In), we receive your display name, email, and a user ID.</li>
        <li><strong>Gameplay data:</strong> Party codes, selected card packs, in-game actions (e.g., hints, votes), basic session metadata (timestamps, player order).</li>
        <li><strong>Diagnostics &amp; device info:</strong> Crash logs, performance metrics, and device information such as OS version and app version, used solely to improve reliability.</li>
        <li><strong>Communications:</strong> Messages you send us (e.g., support requests).</li>
        <li><strong>Website analytics (cookies/local storage):</strong> Non-identifying usage data to understand visits and page performance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style="margin-top:1.2rem;">3) Why we collect it (purposes)</h2>
      <ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
        <li>Provide core app features (multiplayer sessions, syncing game state).</li>
        <li>Authenticate users who choose to sign in.</li>
        <li>Maintain security, prevent abuse, and enforce our terms.</li>
        <li>Fix bugs, improve performance, and support users.</li>
        <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style="margin-top:1.2rem;">4) Legal bases (EEA/UK)</h2>
      <ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
        <li><strong>Performance of a contract:</strong> to provide the app and its features.</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> to secure and improve the service.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> where required (e.g., optional analytics/marketing, if ever used).</li>
        <li><strong>Legal obligation:</strong> to respond to lawful requests.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style="margin-top:1.2rem;">5) Sharing</h2>
      <p>We do not sell your personal data. We share data only with:</p>
      <ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
        <li><strong>Service providers / processors:</strong> cloud hosting, databases, authentication, crash reporting, and analytics providers, bound by contracts to process data on our behalf.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal / safety:</strong> if required by law or to protect users and our service.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style="margin-top:1.2rem;">6) Third-party services used by the app</h2>
      <p>The app and website may integrate the following services:</p>
      <ul style="margin-left:1rem;">
        <li>Google Firebase (Authentication, Firestore Database, Crashlytics, Analytics).</li>
        <li>Google Play Services (Android platform services and updates).</li>
        <li>Google/Apple Sign-In (if you choose to authenticate).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These providers process data as described in their own privacy policies.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:1.2rem;">7) Data retention</h2>
      <p>We keep personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes above. Gameplay records attached to a party code are retained for functionality and audit, then deleted or de-identified when no longer needed. You can request deletion of your account data (see “Your rights”).</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:1.2rem;">8) Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p>Delirium is designed for general audiences and is <strong>not</strong> intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 (or under 16 in the EEA) without appropriate consent as required by law. If you believe a child provided personal data, contact us so we can delete it.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:1.2rem;">9) International transfers</h2>
      <p>We may process and store information in countries outside your own. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses) to protect transferred data.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:1.2rem;">10) Your rights</h2>
      <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or port your data, to object or restrict certain processing, and to withdraw consent where processing relies on consent. You also may have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:1.2rem;">11) Security</h2>
      <p>We implement technical and organizational measures to protect data. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure, but we work to continuously improve safeguards.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:1.2rem;">12) Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>We will update this policy as needed and indicate the “Effective date” above. Material changes will be highlighted within the app or on this page.</p>
